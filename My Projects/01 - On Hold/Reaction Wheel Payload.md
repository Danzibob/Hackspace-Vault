Originally for Mach-23; planned rework for 2024
Original design on [[Fusion360]]
New design on [[OnShape]]

[[Brass]] reaction wheel built on the [[Lathe]] to steer the payload to point towards the sun
Chassis made of threaded rod and printed on [[3D Printers]] from [[PLA]]

### Notes for future redesign
- Consider making all PCBs flat in the X-Y plane, then jumpers can stick up and down easily
	- Also leaves room for batteries & wiring in the main compartment
- Need better connector design - ideally slot together connections as the chassis parts slot together
	- Is JST a good idea for this?
	- Regular Dupont connectors?
- Rods needn't be threaded all the way down; use smooth brass/ally rod and thread manually? (Brass should be at least M5/6, Aluminium at least M8)
- U-Bolt force should transfer directly into a metal plate, then through that into the rods
	- Don't rely on PLA parts to be structural, at least not for the U-Bolt
